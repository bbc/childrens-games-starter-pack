# Brim

Brim is the name given to a [technique](https://github.com/gajus/brim) widely 
adopted by the web industry to workaround issues with Safari's UI 
intruding into the screen during game play. It allows the user to swipe up, 
tap the screen or rotate the device to dismiss the browser UI and return the 
game to full screen.

## BBC implementation
 
The BBC now implements a platform-wide Brim solution, which lives on our CAGE 
environment. As a result, this starter pack no longer includes any code or 
examples relating to Brim. When your game is uploaded to the BBC environment 
Brim will automatically be applied on relevant devices.
