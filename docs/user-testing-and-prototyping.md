# User Testing and prototyping

User testing and prototyping will be a requirement across all of our games to allow us to test ideas, concepts and game mechanics with our target audience.

User Testing allows us to gain an understanding of the key mechanics and user flows of a game idea. We need to determine if a game will be fun, intuitive and that users will want to return.

A prototype phase will typically last between 6 to 8 weeks but this is dependent on the brief and the individual needs of a specific project.

In some instances, particularly when considering our Tier 1 games, we commission a more ambitious prototyping phase prior to commissioning a full production to ensure we are able to deliver a game that our audiences will love. The decision for full production is based on the criteria agreed between the BBC and the successful supplier at the start of the phase as well as feedback from user testing. If approved after the review phase, we will green light the production of the full game.
