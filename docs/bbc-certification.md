# BBC Certification

The BBC Certification process allows the BBC QA team to check that the game/experience loads on our list of devices and browsers and runs safely on our servers. This is carried out following the delivery of the Release Candidate of a game or interactive experience. The process is carried out over an approximate 3 week Certification slot, depending on the robustness and complexity of the delivered Release Candidate. 

The BBC QA team also carry out tests on a smaller range of devices at Alpha and Beta milestones. If issues / defects are identified at either of these stages, these will raised and communicated. The supplier should aim to fix these prior to the next key delivery and MUST fix these prior to Release Candidate delivery.

The BBC QA team is not responsible for carrying out comprehensive testing, although any issues/defects that are identified will be raised accordingly.
