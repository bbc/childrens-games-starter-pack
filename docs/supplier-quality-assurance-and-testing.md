# Supplier Quality Assurance and Testing

All our games/experiences need to be tested to the highest standards against the agreed platforms, operating systems and devices/browsers. Suppliers must ensure full testing of all features across all listed devices, testing must be evidenced at each key milestone (Alpha, Beta and RC) prior to submitting a game/experience for Certification.

Suppliers must ensure their testing is robust and documented test plans and results are expected at each key milestone, these include the Alpha Release and the Beta Release
