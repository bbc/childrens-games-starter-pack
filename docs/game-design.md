# Game Design

Our vision is to create the best games/experiences possible for our audience. At BBC Childrenâ€™s & Education our audience is at the heart of everything we do. With our app and games/experiences portfolio we cover a broad spectrum of segments and audience needs to serve our young audiences with a variety of fun, entertaining and challenging games/experiences and educational content that they love and want to play again and again. Our team is full of passionate people who bring their own expertise and knowledge about our audiences and what they love about our games/experiences, their learning needs and our brands. Together with your expertise in game design and latest gaming trends, we see the process of crafting high quality games and experiences that our audiences love as a collaborative one.
