# Game Delivery Definitions

**Updated - 26/06/2020** - All games contracted after this date must adhere to these Delivery Definitions.

[Tech reviews](tech-review.md) take place at Alpha, Beta and Release Candidate
stages. Feedback should be acted upon for the next delivery as all checks
must pass.

> The BBC has a contractual right to evaluate and test each Deliverable in
accordance with the Acceptance Tests (to be agreed with the supplier and based
on the Game Delivery Definitions outlined below) to determine whether
Acceptance can be given, which may trigger any payment due in relation
to the tested Deliverable.

All games will be checked for adherence to the [Technical Specifications](docs/game-specifications.md).
